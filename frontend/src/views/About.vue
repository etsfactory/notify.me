    <p>Notifyme is a service to manage notifications of a rabbitmq bus. Notifications are sent via email. </p>

    <p>This control panel is used to manage the database. Through the control panel you can create users and subscribe them to different exchanges of the bus. </p>

    <p>In addition, you can edit the message that is sent in the mails to include variables that come in the message that arrives on the bus. </p>

    <p>It is important to know that you have to create the filters of the bus in the same way as they are in the bus, otherwise, no notifications will arrive. </p>
